# 5 Milestones to 100% Completion

Here’s a step-by-step plan to build this project from scratch:

1. **Set Up Server and Database**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js.
   - Install and connect PostgreSQL (local).
   - Define a schema for email metadata (e.g., token, subject, content, recipient).

2. **Generate Unique Tokens**:
   - Create a system to generate a unique token (e.g., UUID) when the director composes an email.
   - Store the token and metadata in the database.
   - Embed the token in button URLs within the email.

3. **Handle Button Clicks**:
   - Build a server endpoint (e.g., `/respond`) to process `token` and `action` parameters.
   - Validate the token and fetch the associated metadata.
   - Generate a response body based on the action (e.g., "Yes, I accept." or "No, I decline.").

4. **Create Mailto Link**:
   - Construct a `mailto` link with:
     - Recipient: Director’s email address.
     - Subject: `RE: [original subject]`.
     - Body: `[response] %0A%0A Original message: [quoted original content]`.
   - Redirect the partner’s browser to this link.

5. **Testing and Security**:
   - Test the full flow with email clients like Gmail and Outlook.
   - Add security features: token expiration (e.g., 7 days), HTTPS enforcement.
   - Ensure the server handles multiple requests and tokens reliably.
